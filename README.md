# GreenJet-Bootstrap

This project is required for the class of Web Development on the National college of Ireland, I did all the code following the especifications of another member of the Duo.

Is a simple web page with a minigame of gussing the altitude of a plane, with a few styles elements as hover zoom in on images, Carousel of images and alerts when you click on the images, all the photos used where from Pexels.com

The project used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.
